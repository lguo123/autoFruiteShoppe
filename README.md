Tried two methods to retrieve the console log.

The first was to use DevTools.  It must be a dependency configuration issue that a devtools session could not be created.

The second attempt was to use LogEntries.  It does retieve console logs but not the FullStory specific logs.  I cannot proceed with the recording assersion without the logs generated by FullStory javascripts.  The strategy would be:

- Collect the newly generated logs of the activity.
- Parse the logs and obtain the type, content, timestamp, etc.
- Assert the output and report the results.
